The directory contains solutions to questions from Sander Van Vugt's RHCE video course.
Questions are commented in the YAML files.
I have to note here that the YAML files here show the progression of knowledge as the course progresses. The exception being the first lab file where some modules that weren't covered till later were used to simplify an otherwise prolonged process.
